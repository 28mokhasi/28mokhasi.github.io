        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
            I have gained valuable experience as a <strong>Student Consultant</strong> at several organizations, where I developed skills in data analysis, project management, and team leadership. At the Elmbrook Education Foundation, I analyzed event data and provided strategic recommendations to the co-chairs and CEO. At Milwaukee Tool, I led meetings, recorded a podcast, and analyzed data to help attract Gen-Z consumers. Additionally, at The Real Good Life, I developed a new eco-friendly packaging model and managed a small team to bring the project to fruition.
