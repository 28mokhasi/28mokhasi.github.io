        <p>Throughout my academic and personal development, I have created several coding projects to showcase my skills. Below are some of the key projects I've worked on, along with descriptions of their functionalities and technologies used:</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Java Library System</h2>
            <p><strong>Java Library System</strong> - Created a fully functioning library system that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles. The system includes a library and user management system, where users can check out books and the system keeps track of book availability and user information. This project involved applying various programming concepts, including arrays, hash maps, and file handling to save and retrieve user data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technologies used: Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling</li>
                <li>Key Features: Book management, User management, Data persistence</li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
                <dt>Technologies</dt>
                <dd>Java, ArrayLists, HashMaps, Serialization, File Writer</dd>
                <dt>Main Functionality</dt>
                <dd>Manages books, users, and data persistence with file saving and loading features.</dd>
            </dl>

        <section>
            <h2>QB Passer Rating Generator</h2>
            <p><strong>QB Passer Rating Generator</strong> - Engineered a system to process football statistics and generate NFL passer ratings. This project involved extracting key statistics from a player's game performance, applying NFL formulas, and producing a final passer rating based on those statistics. The system processes raw data, calculates the relevant stats, and outputs the rating for each quarterback.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technologies used: Python, Data Processing</li>
                <li>Key Features: Statistical calculation, File output generation</li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
                <dt>Technologies</dt>
                <dd>Python, Data Processing</dd>
                <dt>Main Functionality</dt>
                <dd>Automates the process of calculating QB passer ratings from game data.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h2>Snake Game (Java)</h2>
            <p><strong>Snake Game</strong> - Developed a simple version of the classic Snake game with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game features a user-controlled snake that grows longer as it consumes food. The objective is to avoid running into the walls or the snake’s own body. The game tracks the player’s score and allows for a restart after a game over.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technologies used: Java, Java Swing (GUI)</li>
                <li>Key Features: User controls, Score tracking, Game over logic</li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
                <dt>Technologies</dt>
                <dd>Java, Java Swing</dd>
                <dt>Main Functionality</dt>
                <dd>A fully interactive Snake game with a GUI, scoring, and game-over condition.</dd>
            </dl>

            <h2>Interest Finder</h2>
            <p><strong>Interest Finder</strong> - A project that matches users with similar people based on their interests and preferences. The system takes user input such as hobbies, favorite activities, and interests, and finds nearby people with compatible interests. The goal is to help people meet others with shared passions, whether for personal or professional connections.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technologies used: Java</li>
                <li>Key Features: User matching, Interest-based recommendation</li>
            </ul>
            <dl>

            <h2>Blood Drive Simulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Blood Drive Simulator</strong> - Developed a system for managing blood drive events and tracking donations. This project helps manage blood types, the availability of donors, and event scheduling. It simplifies the process for organizing and conducting blood drives by efficiently tracking donor information and ensuring enough blood donations are available for hospitals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technologies used: Java, File Handling</li>
                <li>Key Features: Blood type management, Availability tracking</li>
